  shows tag.snp in open chromatin, intersecting very weak enhancer, < 1
  gh for adamts4 shows same region, score up to 8.5 based on eqtl score of 6e-9
  since we have a later ad-specific eqtl for the tag.snp and NDUFS2, we can infer a ~8 score for
    this enhancer of NDUFS2 as well

* 2017 Mitochondrial genes are altered in blood early in Alzheimer's disease

  Although mitochondrial dysfunction is a consistent feature of Alzheimer's disease in the brain and
  blood, the molecular mechanisms behind these phenomena are unknown. Here we have replicated our
  previous findings demonstrating reduced expression of nuclear-encoded oxidative phosphorylation
  (OXPHOS) subunits and subunits required for the translation of mitochondrial-encoded OXPHOS genes
  in blood from people with Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment. Interestingly this
  was accompanied by increased expression of some mitochondrial-encoded OXPHOS genes, namely those
  residing closest to the transcription start site of the polycistronic heavy chain mitochondrial
  transcript (MT-ND1, MT-ND2, MT-ATP6, MT-CO1, MT-CO2, MT-C03) and MT-ND6 transcribed from the light
  chain. Further we show that mitochondrial DNA copy number was unchanged suggesting no change in
  steady-state numbers of mitochondria. We suggest that an imbalance in nuclear and mitochondrial
  genome-encoded OXPHOS transcripts may drive a negative feedback loop reducing mitochondrial
  translation and compromising OXPHOS efficiency, which is likely to generate damaging reactive
  oxygen species.

  (MRP) genes, and mitochondrial transcriptional regulator genes are decreased in Alzheimer's

  Mitochondrial abnormalities in Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease: can mitochondria be
  targeted therapeutically?

  Mitochondrial abnormalities have been identified as a central mechanism in multiple
  neurodegenerative diseases and, therefore, the mitochondria have been explored as a therapeutic
  target. This review will focus on the evidence for mitochondrial abnormalities in the two most
  common neurodegenerative diseases, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. In addition, we
  discuss the main strategies which have been explored in these diseases to target the mitochondria
  for therapeutic purposes, focusing on mitochondrially targeted antioxidants, peptides, modulators
  of mitochondrial dynamics and phenotypic screening outcomes.

* Mitochondria, OxPhos, and neurodegeneration: cells are not just running out of gas

  Mitochondrial respiratory deficiencies have been observed in numerous neurodegenerative disorders,
  such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. For decades, these reductions in oxidative
  phosphorylation (OxPhos) have been presumed to trigger an overall bioenergetic crisis in the
  neuron, resulting in cell death. While the connection between respiratory defects and neuronal
  death has never been proven, this hypothesis has been supported by the detection of nonspecific
  mitochondrial DNA mutations in these disorders. These findings led to the notion that
  mitochondrial respiratory defects could be initiators of these common neurodegenerative disorders,
  instead of being consequences of a prior insult, a theory we believe to be misconstrued. Herein,
  we review the roots of this mitochondrial hypothesis and offer a new perspective wherein
  mitochondria are analyzed not only from the OxPhos point of view, but also as a complex organelle
  residing at the epicenter of many metabolic pathways.
